# Module 20 : Cryptography

Cryptography and cryptographic ("Crypto") systems help in securing data against interception and compromise during online transmission.&#x20;

Cryptography is the **conversion of data** into a scrambled code that is encrypted and sent over a private or public network.

Cryptography is used to protect confidential data, email messages, chat sessions, web transactions, personal data, corporate data, and e-commerce applications.

There are 2 types of encryption:

1. **Symmetric Encryption:** Use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the message
2. **Asymmetric Encryption:** Use different encryption key, which are called private key and public key.

This encrypted message can be decrypted by **cryptanalysis**.

### The objective of Cryptography:

1. **Confidentiality:** Information can be accessed by only the authorized person.
2. **Integrity:** Trustworthiness of the data or resources.
3. **Non-Repudiation:** Grantee that the sender or receiver can't deny after sending or receiving the messages.&#x20;

#### Government Access to Key (GAK): &#x20;

It is the statutory obligation of individuals and organizations to disclose their cryptographic keys to government agencies.

Government agencies often use key escrow for uninterrupted access to keys. It is a key exchange agreement in which essential cryptographic keys are stored with a third party in escrow.

### Encryption Algorithms:

It is the conversion of readable plain text to unreadable cipher text using a set of complex algorithms that transform data into block or stream cipher or alphanumerical characters.

#### Cipher:

A cipher is an algorithm (a series of well-defined steps) to perform encryption and decryption.

**Encypherment** is the process of converting plaintext into cipher or code.

**Decipherment** is the process of converting cipher text to plain text.
